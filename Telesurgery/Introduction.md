<h1> Introduction </h1>

This project defines a set of attack flows tailored to a cloud-enabled telesurgery system. 

<h1> Project Scope </h1>

This project is focused on threats, attacks and countermeasures that are patient-safety focused. This may include any threat that would result in the disruption of an operation. This includes threats to the availability of the robotic telesurgery system, threats to the integrity and availability of bio-health and telmetry data needed to effectively operate the machinery and evaluate the status of the patient, and threats to cloud services that support diagnostic and other patient-critical functions such as machine learning and data processing. 

<h1> Methodology </h1> 

Publicly-known attacks against hospital operations and medical devices have been documented and mapped to applicable attack flows. Since the technology in review is constantly evolving, theoretical attacks have also been included. When possible, the origin of the attack flow has been marked for each flow (e.g., realized vs theoretical).
