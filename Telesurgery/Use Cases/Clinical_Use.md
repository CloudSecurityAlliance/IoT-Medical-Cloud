<H1> Clinical Use Case </H1> 

Cloud connectivity may be provided through various methods, including 5G cellular. The scope of cloud computing support associated with any particular RAS may vary significantly. Some systems may implement substantial capability in the cloud, including 3D visualization, digital twin support, data fusion and analysis, etc. Other systems may limit cloud support and instead provide localized computing and networking capabilities (e.g,. networking cart).  The following diagram provides a view of the interactions between major components in a typical RAS.
