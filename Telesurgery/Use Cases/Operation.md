<H1> Use Case 1: Robotic Telesurgery with Surgeon On-Site - Device Operations </H1> 

<H2> Description </H2> 
This is a generalized use case for robotic telesurgery.  A robotic telesurgery system is composed of two primary onsite components: (1) a surgeon console, and (2) a Robotic Platform. The system also includes a variety of biosensors and telemetry sensors, communication capabilities, cloud SaaS services, and Electronic Health Record (EHR) interfaces. A surgeon, surgeon assistant and patient all play a role in the surgical activity. Additional staff that may be present include representatives from the vendor, technicians and biomedical staff.
