**We want to protect the patient from harm, so we must guard against misconfigurations in the robotic device.**
- Attack Flow: Attacker uploads malicious firmware to robotic device due to failure to authenticate firmware upload.  
- Attack Flow: Attacker modifies robotic device firmware through compromise of the vendor software update process (note: potential multi-patient effect). 
- Attack Flow: Attacker modifies robotic device configuration file through compromise of a management system. 
- Attack Flow: Attacker modifies device configuration settings through physical access to the device. 
- Attack Flow: Attacker infects robotic device with virus/malicious code through cloned hard-drive, other means. 

**We want to protect the patient from harm, so we must ensure the availabiity of the supporting cloud services. **(e.g. can't perform radiation verification because csp was attacked). 
- Attack Flow: Attacker performs a denial of service through a network flood. 
- Attack Flow: Attacker encrypts critical file through ransomware. 
- Attack Flow: Attacker performs attack on cloud service provider (CSP) that renders services unavailable. 
- Attack Flow: Attacker performs attack on cloud provider resulting in a lack of AI capability (results in further delay to care). 

**We want to protect the patient from harm, so we must ensure that a remote clinician has an accurate view of patient status.**
- Attack Flow: Attacker modifies bio-sensor readings through tampering with biosensor data. 
- Attack Flow: Attacker modifies notification messages meant for the clinician through tampering with data. 

**We want to protect the patient from harm, so we must ensure that remote commands to the robotic device cannot be modified.**
- Attack Flow: Attacker modifies commands sent to the device through tampering with the data. 

**We want to protect the patient from harm, so we must ensure the abailability of supporting communication infrastructure**
- Attack Flow: Attacker disables wireless connectivity within the operating environment. 

**We want to ensure that if something goes wrong in the system, that the root cause can be traced and identified**
- Attack Flow: Attacker modifies log files within a device
- Attack Flow: Attacker modfies log files within a CSP

**We want to ensure that patient privacy is protected**
- Attack Flow: Attacker gains unauthorized access to PHI data
