So we can’t have a misconfiguration in the configuration file 
- upload malicious firmware/ no device authentication of firmware upload
Compromised sw update process
- potential multi-patient effect… 
Physical access to system
- xray machine drive crashed; vendor cloned machine- was infected with virus… 


So we can’t have denial of service
- ransomware
Network flood

Remote clinician must have accurate view of patient status
- corrupted firmware
-malformed readings

Data integrity issues. 
Commands sent to the device (ensure integrity of control stream)
- messages to clinician… 

Lack of cloud availability
-couldn’t do radiation verification because csp was attacked… 
Lack of wireless connectivity


We want to prevent delays caused by lack of AI in the cloud
- take longer to read image
Result in further delays to care


We want to ensure the integrity of the patient data and remote commands

We want to ensure the availability of the system, 

We want to include repudiation protection, so that if something goes wrong it can be traced back to the cause

We want to provide privacy protection for the patient
