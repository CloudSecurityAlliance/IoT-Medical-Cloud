**We want to protect the patient from harm, so we must guard against misconfigurations in the robotic device**
*Attack Flow: Attacker uploads malicious firmware to robotic device due to failure to authenticate firmware upload.  
*Attack Flow: Attacker modifies robotic device firmware through compromise of the vendor software update process (note: potential multi-patient effect)
*Attack Flow: Attacker modifies robotic device configuration file through compromise of a management system. 
*Attack Flow: Attacker modifies device configuration settings through physical access to the device
*Attack Flow: Attacker infects robotic device with virus/malicious code through cloned hard-drive, other means. 

**We want to protect the patient from harm, so we must ensure the availabiity of the supporting cloud services**



So we can’t have denial of service
- ransomware
Network flood

Remote clinician must have accurate view of patient status
- corrupted firmware
-malformed readings

Data integrity issues. 
Commands sent to the device (ensure integrity of control stream)
- messages to clinician… 

Lack of cloud availability
-couldn’t do radiation verification because csp was attacked… 
Lack of wireless connectivity


We want to prevent delays caused by lack of AI in the cloud
- take longer to read image
Result in further delays to care


We want to ensure the integrity of the patient data and remote commands

We want to ensure the availability of the system, 

We want to include repudiation protection, so that if something goes wrong it can be traced back to the cause

We want to provide privacy protection for the patient 









Ransomware attacks
- define clinical impacts

Telemetry monitoring issues impacts nursing
