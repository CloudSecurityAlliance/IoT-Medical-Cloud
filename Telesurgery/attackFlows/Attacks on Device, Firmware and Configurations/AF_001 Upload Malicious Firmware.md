AF_001 Upload Malicious Firmware

<h3>Brief Description:</h3> Authorized personnel unknowingly uploads malicious firmware to the robotic device. Device does not validate authentication and integrity of the firmware upload.

<h3> Potential patient safety risk:</h3> This attack vector would typically require physical access to the device which limits the avenues by which an attack like this can occur.  While somewhat mitigated by the physical access requirements, malicious firmware can present a serious patient safety risk as the device itself can no longer be trusted to function properly as it will not be obvious as to how the firmware was modified without an extensive forensic analysis of the firmware.  As such usage of the device should be considered a serious patient safety risk as all roles the device plays in patient care would need to be considered suspect. 
<h3> Severity Level:</h3> (None, low, medium, high, critical) 
<h3>Impact:</h3> Systems malfunction or unavailability. Malicious manipulation or loss of control, damage to persons and facilities.
