**Use the following design criteria to create each attack flow file. **

1. Attack flows are patient-safety-focused. They should be designed from the perspective of protecting the patient. This will allow for easier buy-in from HDOs.
 
2. Attack flows should be modular. Although many attack trees grow significantly, a modular approach makes it easier to manage the flows and supports mixing and matching to create multiple attack pathways. Modularity should be based on key decision points in an attack process (for example, once you've compromised a key, the attacker can move on to other attacks). Modularity is represented through the integration of multiple, modular files. 

3. A set of modular attack flow files represents an attack use case. The attack use case is the patient-focused artifact that is composed of many attack flows. 

4. This project integrates the MITRE ATT&CK techniques (https://attack.mitre.org/). This will allow HDOs to leverage ATT&CK technique mitigations in an enterprise security architecture. 

5. Attack flows will form the basis for a STRIDE-based threat model. Nodes in the attack flow will correspond to nodes in the STRIDE analysis.
