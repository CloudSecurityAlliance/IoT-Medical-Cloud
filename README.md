Focus Area: 		Medical Device Security
Project Title: 		Cloud Security for Connected Medical Devices

<h2> Purpose:  </h2>

(1) Provide a set of security patterns that MDMs and CSPs/ SaaS partners can use to securely design AI/ML-based medical devices. 

(2) Provide HDOs with a way to objectively understand and measure the security of any given AI/ML-based medical device product offering. 

<h2> Abstract:  </h2>
Medical devices are becoming reliant on cloud services that support machine learning, data storage, EHR integration, messaging, digital twins, and various other capabilities. Medical Device Manufacturers (MDMs) must design secure architectures and implement secure configurations of these cloud services in order to assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data and the safety of patients. Failure to do so may result in degradation of service availability, tampering or manipulation of patient diagnosis or treatment plans, or compromise of protected health information (PHI). 

This project will define one or more reference architectures for backend cloud services, integrations/ APIs and edge medical devices. This may include software-as-a-medical device (SaMD), telehealth devices, and on-premise connected medical devices. Threat modeling will be conducted on the defined reference architectures, using the MITRE Threat Modeling Playbook. Identified threats will be used to determine recommended security controls to apply to the SaaS/Device and a shared responsibility model will be created that allocates control responsibility across CSP, MDM, HDO, EHR Vendor, and Patient based on the specific reference architecture. 

Additional efforts may be undertaken after identification of controls, including but not limited to:

* Definition of a comprehensive security architecture
* Creation of security as code artifacts using tools such as Terraform


<h2> Stakeholders </h2>
* Health Delivery Organizations (HDOs)
* Medical Device Manufacturers (MDMs)
* Electronic Health Record (EHR) providers
* Cloud Security Providers (CSPs)

<h2> Goals </h2>
* Define one or more cloud-based medical device reference architectures 
* Create a threat model based on defined reference architectures (~Summer 2022)
* Identify cyber security controls to mitigate identified threats
* Assign responsibilities using a RACI format to each identified control
