Use Case 1: Robotic Telesurgery with Surgeon On-Site; Device Operations
  
<H1> Description </H1>
This is a generalized use case for robotic telesurgery.  A robotic telesurgery system is composed of two primary onsite components: (1) a surgeon console, and (2) a Robotic Platform. The system also includes a variety of biosensors and telemetry sensors, communication capabilities, cloud SaaS services, and Electronic Health Record (EHR) interfaces. A surgeon, surgeon assistant and patient all play a role in the surgical activity. Additional staff that may be present include representatives from the vendor, technicians and biomedical staff.

<H2> Surgeon Console </H2> 
The Surgeon Console typically includes the capabilities and features that are needed by the surgeon to perform the operation. (Rashid, 2020) identifies the following sub-components that typically make up a surgeon console supporting a robotic platform:

* Haptic Device Components
* Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* Foot Pedal
* 3D Video Display
* Microphone
* Audio Speaker

The surgeon console requires reliable network communication. Command and Control (C2) data is transmitted from the surgeon console to the robotic platform. Device telemetry and patient bio-sensor data are received at the Surgeon Console and processed for display on the GUI. Consoles may in some cases also include an eye tracker to identify instances where the surgeon is not focused on the task at hand. This is a safety feature. 
The surgeon console may also provide local augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) capabilities. These capabilities may also be augmented or replaced by a cloud service implementation. 

<H2> Robotic Platform </H2> 
The robotic platform may be encompassed within a larger set of components. The robotic platform includes the robotic arm(s) that perform the actions as commanded by the surgeon. The robotic arm transmits telemetry data to the surgeon console and to the cloud. Haptic feedback may be generated based on the positioning of the robotic platform and fed to the surgeon console.
